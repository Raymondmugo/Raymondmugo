## What I Do

I'm a **full-stack web developer** with skills in both front-end and back-end development. My current focus, however, is on sharpening my **data analytics and visualization skills** through hands-on projects. Lately, I've also been captivated by the potential of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and I'm actively exploring projects in these fields.

This repository will serve as a showcase for my journey in data science, highlighting my ability to build compelling data-driven stories.
